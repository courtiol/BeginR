\section{What is \r?}

\subsection{\r \ in brief}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{\r \ in brief}
\justifying
\r \ is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing \& graphics.
\vfill
Key points about \r:
\begin{itemize}
\item free \underline{for all}
\item open source (explore: \url{https://github.com/wch/r-source})
\pause
\item polyvalent:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item from laptop to most advanced supercomputers
  \item local or remote
  \item Windows, MacOS, linux or many other Unix-based systems
  \end{itemize}
\pause
\item rich (tons of \r \ packages out there)
\item cutting edge (check updates for today: \url{http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/cran/updated})
\pause
\item used by millions
\end{itemize}
\pause
\vfill
CONCLUSION: \r \ is the best software environment for statistical computing (but it is far from perfect!)

\r \ tooks its syntax and tools from the \s, and its semantic from \texttt{Scheme}

%note: all date at 01-01 are approximative (could be any time during the year)
%Due to the ownership of \s \ by a phone company, \s \ could not be free, nor open source. Hence \r?
%developer of S try to keep it non commercial as much they could!
%Unix was conceived one floor upstairs at Bell Labs, C and C++ are also coming from Bells Labs (New Jersey)
%Bells Labs is now owned by NOKIA

\subsection{the course}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{What will we do?}
I will:
\begin{itemize}
\item give you all the slides (so write only what is not being displayed)
\item explain you the main principles of the \r \ language and some useful functions
\item provide you with short exercises to put concepts into practice
\item provide you with suggestions on how to learn more about \r \ on your own
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\pause
You will not:
\begin{itemize}
\item be fluent in the \r \ language after one week
\item be able to remember how to implement many of the things we will see
\end{itemize}
\pause
\vfill
You should:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``\emph{accept that you are gonna be frustrated, accept that you are gonna be bad at it for a while, but you have to keep going anyway\dots}'' (Wickham 2018, \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxdf8evD6pQ})
\item ask any silly question that pops up in your creative minds
\item let me know immediately when you stop following
\end{itemize}
