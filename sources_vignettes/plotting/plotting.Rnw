\begin{frame}{Why plot in \r?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Powerful (large range of plot types)
\item Fully customizable (make your own style)
\item Practical (integrate your plots and your code together)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Graphics paradigms in \r}
They are three dominant graphics paradigms in \r:
\begin{itemize}
\item traditional graphics (based on \verb`graphics`)
\item \verb`lattice` (based on \verb`grid`)
\item \verb`ggplot2` (based on \verb`grid`)
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\pause
Note:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb`graphics` and \verb`grid` are part of any basic installation of \r
\item \verb`lattice` is part of the so-called list of CRAN recommended packages
\item \verb`ggplot2` is part of the \texttt{tidyverse} universe (from RStudio)
\item we will focus on traditional graphics and \verb`ggplot2` (\verb`lattice` is excellent but a bit more difficult)
\item some other packages are sometimes useful too (e.g. \verb`rgl`, \verb`plotly`)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%% SCATTERPLOT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{scatter plot}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
In traditional graphics, use \verb`plot()` to draw a scatter plot:
<<scatter_base_1>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can choose what type of scatter plot to display with argument type:
% mind that using only<>{} prevents to correctly display dollar signs, and tildes...
<<scatter_base_2a>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, type = "p")
@
\vfill
Note: see \verb`"?plot.default"`.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can choose what type of scatter plot to display with argument type:
<<scatter_base_2b>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, type = "l")
@
\vfill
Note: it makes more sense when data are ordered\dots
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can choose what type of scatter plot to display with argument type:
<<scatter_base_2c>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, type = "b")
@
\vfill
Note: it makes more sense when data are ordered\dots
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can choose what type of scatter plot to display with argument type:
<<scatter_base_2d>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, type = "o")
@
\vfill
Note: it makes more sense when data are ordered\dots
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can choose what type of scatter plot to display with argument type:
<<scatter_base_2e>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, type = "h")
@
\vfill
Note: it makes more sense when x-values are unique\dots
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can change point shapes (pch) and colour (col):
<<scatter_base_3a>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, pch = 16, col = "blue")
@
\vfill
Note: you can use colour names.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can change point shapes (pch) and colour (col):
<<scatter_base_3a_bis>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, pch = 16, col = 4)
@
\vfill
Note: you can use numbers to describe basic colours.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can change point shapes (pch) and colour (col):
<<scatter_base_3a_ter>>=
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, pch = 16, col = "#0000FFFF")
rgb(red = 0, green = 0, blue = 255, alpha = 255, maxColorValue = 255)
@
\vfill
Note: you can have full control using hexadecimal!!
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can change point shapes (pch) and colour (col):
<<scatter_base_3b>>=
palette(c("red", "blue", "green"))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, pch = 17, col = iris$Species)
@
\vfill
Note: you can use a palette to match the levels of a factor.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can change point shapes (pch) and colour (col):
<<scatter_base_3c, fig.width=9, fig.height=3, out.width="0.9\\linewidth", out.height="0.3\\linewidth">>=
plot(rep(1, 25) ~ I(1:25), data = iris, pch = 1:25, col = rainbow(25))
@
\vfill
Note:
\begin{itemize}
\item there are 25 basic symbols (but other ways allow to use many more)
\item check \verb`"?rainbow"` for a list of different color palettes
\item the \verb`I()` allows for the creation of the vector before being interpreted by \verb`plot()`
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
For some point shapes you can set both an outline colour (col) and background colour (bg):
\begin{columns}
\column[t]{0.48\linewidth}
<<scatter_base_4a, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.7\\linewidth">>=
palette(c("red", "blue", "green"))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, cex = 2,
     pch = 21, col = "black", bg = iris$Species, lwd = 2)
@

\column[t]{0.48\linewidth}
<<scatter_base_4b, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.7\\linewidth">>=
palette(c("red", "blue", "green"))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, cex = 2,
     pch = 21, col = iris$Species, bg = "black", lwd = 2)
@
\end{columns}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can add a legend to the plot:
<<scatter_base_5>>=
palette(c("red", "blue", "green"))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, pch = 21, bg = iris$Species)
legend(x = "topleft", legend = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"), pch = 21, pt.bg = c("red", "blue", "green"), bty = "n")
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can add lines to the plot:
<<scatter_base_6a>>=
palette(c("red", "blue", "green"))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, pch = 21, bg = iris$Species)
abline(v = mean(iris$Petal.Width), lty = 2, col = "red", lwd = 2)
abline(h = mean(iris$Petal.Length), lty = 3, col = "black", lwd = 2)
abline(a = 1.084, b = 2.23, lty = 1, lwd = 2)
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can add lines to the plot:
\vfill
\begin{columns}
\column{0.48\linewidth}
<<scatter_base_6b, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.7\\linewidth">>=
plot(NULL, xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(-1, 7))
abline(h = 0, lty = 0, lwd = 2)
abline(h = 1, lty = 1, lwd = 2)
abline(h = 2, lty = 2, lwd = 2)
abline(h = 3, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
abline(h = 4, lty = 4, lwd = 2)
abline(h = 5, lty = 5, lwd = 2)
abline(h = 6, lty = 6, lwd = 2)
@
\column{0.48\linewidth}
<<scatter_base_6c, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.7\\linewidth">>=
plot(NULL, xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(-1, 7))
abline(h = 0, lty = 1, lwd = 0.2)
abline(h = 1, lty = 1, lwd = 0.5)
abline(h = 2, lty = 1, lwd = 1)
abline(h = 3, lty = 1, lwd = 2)
abline(h = 4, lty = 1, lwd = 3)
abline(h = 5, lty = 1, lwd = 4)
abline(h = 6, lty = 1, lwd = 5)
@
\end{columns}
\vfill
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can also add additional points to the plot:
<<scatter_base_7>>=
versicolor <- subset(iris, Species == "versicolor")
setosa     <- subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = versicolor, pch = 21, bg = "blue", xlim = range(iris$Petal.Width), ylim = range(iris$Petal.Length))
points(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = setosa, pch = 21, bg = "red", xlim = range(iris$Petal.Width), ylim = range(iris$Petal.Length))
@
\vfill
Note: You need to make sure the axis limits are the same!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can add text and arrows:
<<scatter_base_8>>=
palette(c("red", "blue", "green"))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, pch = 21, bg = iris$Species, ylim = c(0.8, 7.2))
max.value <- iris[iris$Petal.Length == max(iris$Petal.Length), ]
arrows(x0 = max.value$Petal.Width - 0.75, y0 = max.value$Petal.Length,
       x1 = max.value$Petal.Width, y1 = max.value$Petal.Length, lwd = 2)
text(x = max.value$Petal.Width - 0.9, y = max.value$Petal.Length, labels = "Max")
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
Including an interval around a prediction line requires you to build a polygon:
<<scatter_base_9, out.height="0.3\\linewidth", out.width="0.3\\linewidth">>=
test_mod <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris)
newdat   <- data.frame(Petal.Width = seq(0, 3, length.out = 100))
pred     <- predict(test_mod, newdata = newdat, interval = "confidence")

plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, pch = 21, bg = "grey")
polygon(x = c(newdat$Petal.Width, rev(newdat$Petal.Width)),
        y = c(pred[, "lwr"], rev(pred[, "upr"])),
        col = alpha("purple", alpha = 0.4),  ## alpha sets transparency!
        border = NA)  ## removes black line around the polygon
abline(test_mod, lty = 2, lwd = 2)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% BOXPLOT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{box plots}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: box plots}
In traditional graphics, use \verb`boxplot()` to draw a box plot:
<<boxplot_base_1>>=
boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: box plots}
Many of the same changes made to scatter plots can be made here:
<<boxplot_base_2>>=
boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, col = "grey", lwd = 2, lty = 3)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: box plots}
There are also some boxplot specific arguments:
<<boxplot_base_3>>=
boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, width = c(1, 2, 1), notch = TRUE)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: box plots}
You can retrieve information by storing the output in an object:
<<boxplot_base_4>>=
my_boxcox <- boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, plot = FALSE)

my_boxcox
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% HISTOGRAMS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{histograms}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: histograms}
In traditional graphics, use \verb`hist()` to draw an histogram:
<<hist_base_1>>=
hist(iris$Petal.Length, main = "") ## main used here to remove the automatic title
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: histograms}
You can change the number and location of breaks between bins:
<<hist_base_2>>=
hist(iris$Petal.Length, main = "", breaks = 5, col = "grey")
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: histograms}
You can change the number and location of breaks between bins:
<<hist_base_3>>=
hist_breaks <- seq(min(iris$Petal.Length), max(iris$Petal.Length), length.out = 10)
hist(iris$Petal.Length, main = "", breaks = hist_breaks, col = "grey")
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: histograms}
You can change the number and location of breaks between bins:
<<hist_base_4>>=
hist_breaks <- seq(min(iris$Petal.Length), max(iris$Petal.Length), length.out = 10)
hist(iris$Petal.Length, main = "", breaks = hist_breaks, col = "grey")
rug(x = iris$Petal.Length, col = "blue")
@
\vfill
Note: it never hurts to add a rug under an histogram!
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Bar plots
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{bar plots}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Traditional graphics: bar plots}
<<bar_base_0>>=
spp_means <- data.frame(Species = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"),
                        mean = as.numeric(by(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Species, mean)),
                        SE = as.numeric(by(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Species, function(x)sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))))
                        )

spp_means
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: bar plots}
In traditional graphics, use \verb`barplot()` to draw a bar plot:
<<bar_base_1>>=
barplot(height = spp_means$mean, names.arg = spp_means$Species, ylim = c(0, 7),
        xlab = "Species", ylab = "Mean petal length (cm)")
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: bar plots}
Adding error bars can be done with the arrows function:
<<bar_base_2>>=
bar_locations <- barplot(height = spp_means$mean, names.arg = spp_means$Species, plot = FALSE)
barplot(height = spp_means$mean, names.arg = spp_means$Species, ylim = c(0, 7),
        xlab = "Species", ylab = "Mean petal length (cm)")
arrows(x0 = bar_locations[, 1], x1 = bar_locations[, 1],
       y0 = spp_means$mean - 2*spp_means$SE, y1 = spp_means$mean + 2*spp_means$SE,
       angle = 90, lwd = 2, code = 3, length = 0.1)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: bar plots}
As before, there are similar arguments available:
<<bar_base_3>>=
barplot(height = spp_means$mean, names.arg = spp_means$Species, ylim = c(0, 7),
        xlab = "Species", ylab = "Mean petal length (cm)",
        col = "white", cex.axis = 0.75)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% AESTHETICS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{aesthetics}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Combining plots}
You can easily combine multiple traditional graphics using global parameters:
<<aes_2, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, out.width="0.6\\linewidth", out.height="0.3\\linewidth">>=
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris)
boxplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, col = "grey")
par(oldpar) ## restore default values
@
\vfill
Note: if you want to combine graphics of different sizes it is a bit more complex (see \verb`?layout`).
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Facetting}
This can be used to created 'facet' plots:
<<aes_3, fig.width=15, fig.height=5, out.width="0.9\\linewidth", out.height="0.3\\linewidth">>=
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
split_data <- split(iris, iris$Species)
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = split_data$setosa, main = "Setosa", pch = 21,
     bg = "red", col = "black", xlim = range(iris$Petal.Width), ylim = range(iris$Petal.Length))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = split_data$virginica, main = "Virginica", pch = 21,
     bg = "blue", col = "black", xlim = range(iris$Petal.Width), ylim = range(iris$Petal.Length))
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = split_data$versicolor, main = "Versicolor", pch = 21,
     bg = "green", col = "black", xlim = range(iris$Petal.Width), ylim = range(iris$Petal.Length))
par(oldpar) ## restore default values
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Facetting}
Note: there is also an easier function for that:
<<aes_3_bis, fig.width=15, fig.height=5, out.width="0.9\\linewidth", out.height="0.3\\linewidth">>=
coplot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width | Species, data = iris, rows = 1)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Background}
Global parameters can also be used to change the background colour:
<<aes_9>>=
oldpar <- par(bg = "pink")
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris)
par(oldpar) ## restore default values
@
\vfill
Note: you can also plot a background image but you need to use specific packages for that.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Modifying typefaces}
Global parameters can also be used to change the typeface:
<<aes_4>>=
oldpar <- par(family = "serif")
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris,
     xlab = "Petal Width (cm)", ylab = "Petal Length (cm)",
     cex.lab = 1.25, cex.axis = 1.25, col.axis = "red")
par(oldpar) ## restore default values
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Special characters}
You can use weird characters:%png device below to render the unicode!
<<aes_8, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", out.height = "0.3\\linewidth", dev='png'>>=
foo <- round(pi, 3)
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris,
     xlab = expression(beta^2 + 2[alpha]), ylab = expression(paste(italic("bla bla bla"))),
     main = paste("Plot number", foo))
text(0.4, 4, "\u2640", cex = 3) ## requires font with unicode installed (try it!)
text(0.6, 4, "\\VE", vfont = c("serif", "plain"), cex = 3)
@
\vfill
Note: unicode characters are nice but source of problems. How to make it work depends on both the OS, graphical device and typefaces installed on your computer.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Plot margins}
Global parameters can also be used to change individual plot margins (\textcolor{blue}{blue}) and outer margins (\textcolor{green}{green}):

\section{Plotting with \texttt{ggplot}}
\subsection{introduction}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{ggplot}: introduction}
\verb`ggplot` (defunct) and \verb`ggplot2` were both created by Hadley Wickham (now chief Scientist at Rstudio) during his PhD: \url{http://had.co.nz/thesis/practical-tools-hadley-wickham.pdf}
\vfill
\pause
The idea was to create a grammar of graphics for \r.
\vfill
It is inspired from the seminal Leland Wilkson's book \textbf{The Grammar of Graphics}:
\justifying
\emph{"This book [...] presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems."}
\vfill
\pause
In Wickham's words:\\
\emph{"The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question: what is a statistical graphic? [\dots] In brief, the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a
mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinate system. Facetting can be used to generate the same plot for different subsets of the dataset. It is the combination of these independent components that make up a graphic."} (Wickham ggplot2 book)
\vfill
\pause
In plain english, that means that the graphics are build by considering building blocs or layers. The originality is that the user directly handles different functions corresponding to each layer and can combine them freely.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: introduction}
Overall structure of a \texttt{ggplot} call:
<<scatter_gg_2, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", out.height = "0.3\\linewidth">>=
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) + ## we specify the source of data and map the variables
  geom_point() + ## we use a function that specifies the type of plot (e.g. scatterplot, histogram). A geom_* function is always required!
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5)) + ## we can fiddle with the scale_*_* functions to adjust the axes, colouration etc.
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 22)) # we can use one of the theme_* functions to change things like legends, font size etc.
@
\vfill
Note: to better understand, execute the code progressively adding one command at a time!
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% SCATTERPLOT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{scatter plots}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
We start by preparing the data:
<<scatter_0>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length))
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
We add points on the empty plot:
<<scatter_gg_3>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) + geom_point()
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
You can change point shapes \verb`shape` (= \verb`pch` in traditional graphics) and \verb`colour` (= \verb`col` in traditional graphics):
<<scatter_gg_4>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 16, size = 3)
@
\vfill
Note: everytime we want to create a connection between the data and some elements of the plot, we use the same function: \verb`aes()`!
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
In ggplot the legend is included by default but you can remove it:
<<scatter_gg_5, fig.width = 5, out.width = "0.35\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 16, size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
The aesthetic function in ggplot is a powerful tool for changing plot aesthetics.

If you specify an aesthetic argument inside \verb`aes()`, it will give each point a different aesthetic based on its value.

If you specify the same aesthetic argument outside \verb`aes()`, it will give all data points the same aesthetic:
\begin{columns}
\column[t]{0.48\linewidth}
<<scatter_gg_6a, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.6\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length,
                                  colour = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 16, size = 3)
@
\column[t]{0.48\linewidth}
<<scatter_gg_6b, out.width="0.6\\linewidth", out.height="0.6\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue", shape = 16, size = 3)
@
\end{columns}
\vfill
Note: we have used \verb`aes()` to apply colours but it can be used to make other changes (see later).
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
Again, for many elements you can set both an outline \verb`colour` (= \verb`col` for traditional graphics) and background \verb`fill` colour (= \verb`bg` for traditional graphics):
\begin{columns}
\column[t]{0.48\linewidth}
<<scatter_gg_7a, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.6\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length,
                                  colour = Species)) +
  geom_point(fill = "black", shape = 21)
@

\column[t]{0.48\linewidth}
<<scatter_gg_7b, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.6\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length,
                                  fill = Species)) +
  geom_point(colour = "black", shape = 21)
@
\end{columns}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
You can also add lines to the plot:
<<scatter_gg_8>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(x = iris$Petal.Length), lty = 3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(x = iris$Petal.Width), lty = 2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 1.084, slope = 2.23, lty = 1)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
You can add extra points to the plot by using two \verb`geom_point` layers:
<<scatter_gg_9>>=
versicolor <- subset(x = iris, Species == "versicolor")
setosa     <- subset(x = iris, Species == "setosa")
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = versicolor, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length), fill = "red", shape = 21, size = 3) +
  geom_point(data = setosa, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length), fill = "blue", shape = 21, size = 3)
@
\vfill
Note 1: unlike traditional plots, \verb`ggplot` will automatically adjust the axes limits.\\
Note 2: if needed you can define the \texttt{aes()} in the \texttt{geom}s!!
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Traditional graphics: scatter plots}
You can add text and arrows:
<<scatter_gg_10, out.height="0.3\\linewidth", out.width="0.35\\linewidth">>=
max.value <- iris[iris$Petal.Length == max(iris$Petal.Length), ]
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = max.value$Petal.Width - 0.75,
                   xend = max.value$Petal.Width,
                   y = max.value$Petal.Length,
                   yend = max.value$Petal.Length), size = 1,
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm"))) +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(x = max.value$Petal.Width - 0.9, y = max.value$Petal.Length, label = "Max"))
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
In ggplot, confidence intervals can be added with specialised function \verb`geom_ribbon()`:
<<scatter_gg_11, out.height="0.3\\linewidth", out.width="0.35\\linewidth">>=
test_mod <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris)
newdat   <- data.frame(Petal.Width = seq(0, 3, length.out = 100))
pred     <- predict(test_mod, newdata = newdat, interval = "confidence")

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = iris,    mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length), fill = "grey", shape = 21, size = 3) +
  geom_ribbon(data = newdat, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, ymin = pred[, 2], ymax = pred[, 3]), fill = "purple", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(intercept = coef(test_mod)[1], slope = coef(test_mod)[2], lty = 2)
@
\vfill
Note: because we are building the plot with two different datasets (i.e. \verb`iris` \& \verb`newdat`), we specify the \texttt{data} and \texttt{aes()} separately in each line of the ggplot code.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: scatter plots}
In ggplot, you can also do basic statistics directly:
<<out.height="0.3\\linewidth", out.width="0.35\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point(fill = "grey", shape = 21, size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", fill = "pink", colour = "red")
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% BOXPLOT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{box plots}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: box plots}
In ggplot, use \verb`geom_boxplot()` to draw a box plot:
<<boxplot_gg_1F>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot()
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: box plots}
Many of the same changes made to scatter plots can be made here:
<<boxplot_gg_2>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "grey", size = 1, lty = 2)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% HISTOGRAM
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{histograms}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: histograms}
In ggplot, use \verb`geom_histogram()` to draw an histogram:
<<hist_gg_1>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram()
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: histograms}
You can change the width of bins with \verb`binwidth` or their number with \verb`bins`:
\begin{columns}
\column{0.48\linewidth}
<<hist_gg_2, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.7\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, colour = "black", fill = "grey")
@
\column{0.48\linewidth}
<<hist_gg_2bis, out.width="0.7\\linewidth", out.height="0.7\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 6, colour = "black", fill = "grey")
@
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: histograms}
Add a rug below the histogram with \verb`geom_rug`:
<<hist_gg_3>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, colour = "black", fill = "grey") +
  geom_rug()
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Bar plots
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{bar plots}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: bar plots}
In ggplot, use \verb`geom_col()` to draw a bar plot:
<<bar_gg_1>>=
ggplot(data = spp_means, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = mean)) +
  geom_col()
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: bar plots}
Adding error bars in ggplot is much easier than in traditional graphics:
<<bar_gg_2>>=
ggplot(data = spp_means, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = mean)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - SE, ymax = mean + SE), width = 0.1)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: bar plots}
As before, modifications are straigthforward:
<<bar_gg_3>>=
ggplot(data = spp_means, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = mean)) +
  geom_col(fill = "white", colour = "black")
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% AESTHETICS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{aesthetics}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Introduction to aesthetics}
In ggplot, you can change aesthetics in individual segments of the code (\verb`aes()`) \textit{or} you can change information for the whole plot using themes (\verb`theme()`).
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Using the aesthetic function more}
We'll start by looking back at \verb`aes()`.

We can use it to change multiple aesthetics of a plot:
<<aes_gg_1>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, fill = Species, size = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Using the aesthetic function more}
Here we change the transparency:
<<aes_gg_2>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, fill = Species, alpha = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 5)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Using the aesthetic argument more}
Applying aesthetics to continuous variables will be different to categorical variables:
<<aes_gg_3>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, fill = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 5)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Using the aesthetic argument more}
You can indicate values for a third dimension in different ways:
\begin{columns}
\column[t]{0.48\linewidth}
<<aes_gg_4a, out.width="0.8\\linewidth", out.height="0.7\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length,
                                  fill = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 5) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "black")
@
\column[t]{0.48\linewidth}
<<aes_gg_4b, out.width="0.8\\linewidth", out.height="0.7\\linewidth">>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length,
                                  size = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = "grey") +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 10))
@
\end{columns}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Change text}
You can change size and colour of axis text easily:
<<aes_gg_5, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", out.height = "0.3\\linewidth",>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Petal Width (cm)") +
  ylab("Petal Length (cm") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12, colour = "red"), axis.title = element_text(size = 12))
@
\vfill
Note: the text size uses different measurement units than traditional graphics.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Combining plots}
Combining plots is less straightforward in \texttt{ggplot}\dots
\vfill
You need to use an additional package:
<<aes_gg_6, out.width = "0.56\\linewidth", out.height = "0.28\\linewidth", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, message = FALSE>>=
scatter <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) + geom_point() +
  xlab("Petal Width (cm)") + ylab("Petal Length (cm")

box     <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) + geom_boxplot()

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(scatter, box, nrow = 1)
@
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Faceting}
Although combining multiple plots is cumbersome, there is an inbuilt function to create facets:
<<aes_gg_7, out.width = "0.9\\linewidth", out.height = "0.3\\linewidth", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 15>>=
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", size = 3) +
  xlab("Petal Width (cm)") +
  ylab("Petal Length (cm)") +
  facet_wrap(~ Species)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Modifying typefaces}
Unlike traditional graphics, in \texttt{ggplot} you can easily change the typeface of individual elements in theme:
<<aes_gg_8, out.width = "0.56\\linewidth", out.height = "0.28\\linewidth", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10>>=
scatter <- ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Petal Width (cm)") +
  ylab("Petal Length (cm") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12, colour = "red", family = "serif"), axis.title = element_text(size = 12, family = "mono"))

box     <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12, colour = "red", family = "sans"), axis.title = element_text(size = 12, family = "sans"))

grid.arrange(scatter, box, nrow = 1)
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Special characters}
You can use weird characters:
<<aes_gg_9, dev='png'>>=
foo <- round(pi, 3)
ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = expression(beta^2 + 2[alpha]), y = expression(paste(italic("bla bla bla"))), title = paste("Plot number", foo)) +
  annotate("text", x = c(0.4, 0.5), y = c(4, 4), label = c("\u2640", "\u2642"), size = 12) + ## requires font with unicode installed (try it!)
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 20))
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Plot margins}
Plot margins are also controlled in theme of each plot individually:
<<aes_gg_10, out.width = "0.56\\linewidth", out.height = "0.28\\linewidth", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10>>=
scatter <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
           geom_point() +
           xlab("Petal Width (cm)") +
           ylab("Petal Length (cm") +
           theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12, colour = "red"),
                 axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
                 plot.margin = unit(c(30, 4, 1, 1), "mm"))

box     <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) +
           geom_boxplot() +
           theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12, colour = "red"),
                 axis.title = element_text(size = 12))

grid.arrange(scatter, box, nrow = 1)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Preset themes}
\texttt{ggplot} also has a number of preset themes that you can use:
<<aes_gg_11, out.width = "0.75\\linewidth", out.height = "0.25\\linewidth", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 15>>=
grey <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_grey()

bw <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

classic <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()

grid.arrange(grey, bw, classic, nrow = 1)
@
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Preset themes}
You can create your own theme once for all!
<<own_theme, out.height = "0.3\\linewidth", out.width = "0.3\\linewidth",>>=
theme_pink <- theme_classic() %+replace% theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "pink"))

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point()+
  theme_pink
@
\vfill
Note: check \verb`?theme` for the list of options that can be changed.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{Preset themes}
You can set a theme for all plots with \verb`theme_set`
<<own_theme2, out.height = "0.3\\linewidth", out.width = "0.3\\linewidth",>>=
theme_old  <- theme_set(theme_pink)

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point()

theme_set(theme_old) ## restore original theme
@
\end{frame}

\subsection{saving your plot}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile, t]{\texttt{ggplot}: Exporting}
<<tidy=F, eval=F>>=
?ggsave
@
\vspace{0.5cm}
<<tidy=F, eval=F>>=
classic <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_classic()

ggsave("ggplot.pdf", plot = classic, width = 15, height = 5)
@
\end{frame}


\subsection{other plots}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{There are other \texttt{geom} out there!}
There are a few other plot types in \texttt{ggplot} that are worth looking at (check the cheatsheet!):
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb`geom_violin()`
\item \verb`geom_area()`
\item \verb`geom_smooth()`
\item \verb`geom_density()`
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\pause
But the true force of having developed something as modular as \texttt{ggplot} is that there are many more packages each week providing \texttt{ggplot} extensions!
\vfill
A few random examples of \texttt{ggplot} extensions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb`ggExtra` (for marginal distribution)
\item \verb`ggthemes` (for extra themes, including \verb`theme_excel()`!! :-/)
\item \verb`ggmap` (for maps)
\item \verb`ggrepel` (for adding labels to plots)
\item \verb`ggalt` (for creating cluster plots)
\item \verb`cowplot` (for creating nested figures)
% to be completed!
\end{itemize}
\vfill
Note: see also \url{http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/} (but the list is incomplete).

\section{Conclusion: traditional graphics vs. \texttt{ggplot}}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Which plotting tool should you use?}
\begin{columns}
\column[t]{0.45\linewidth}
\begin{block}{Traditional graphics:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item no new packages required
  \item arguments often differ between functions
  \item help files useful
  \item easier for doing something simple
  \item more difficult for doing something complex
  \item main restriction: always add things on top of what has already been plotted
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\pause
\column[t]{0.45\linewidth}
\begin{block}{\texttt{ggplot}:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item requires multiple packages for best results
  \item uniform grammar
  \item help files often useless (due to modularity)
  \item more difficult for doing something simple
  \item easier for doing something complex
  \item faster for large datasets
  \item more accessible than lattice
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{columns}

$\rightarrow$ It may be useful to know both!!
