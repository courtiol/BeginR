\begin{frame}{Practice}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item check that you do get internet access
  \item install \r: \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Why using the RStudio IDE?}
You can use \r \ without RStudio, but RStudio is:
\begin{itemize}
\item provided with more functionalities than the official \r \ IDE
\item integrated with several key \r \ packages developed by RStudio (e.g. \texttt{rmarkdown})
\item suitable for both desktop and remote computers (web server) %so it looks the same on a cluster!
\item free and open source
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Overall structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Top menu
\item Toolbar (small subset from the top menu)
\item 4 visible panes
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \item \texttt{File $\rightarrow$ Save}

    \item \texttt{Tools $\rightarrow$ Global Options...}
    \item \texttt{Help $\rightarrow$ Check for Updates} (for updating RStudio, not \r, nor \r \ packages)

    \item have a look at the RStudio cheatsheet
  \end{enumerate}
\vfill
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item a project is defined by a simple (text) file. Its main benefit is to open RStudio with the correct working directory set (that is, the one where the project file is)
\item an \r \ markdown file is a (text) file where we can write text together with code (more later)

\begin{frame}{The \texttt{Console} pane}
This is where you can run \r \ code directly
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.8\textheight]{../figures/RStudio_pane2.png}

Notes: tabs give you access to a other panes depending on the context. They are all used to run code!

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.8\textheight]{../figures/RStudio_pane34.png}
\end{center}
Notes: tabs give you access to various panes
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The other panes}
You should have at least access to:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{Environment}: the list of object known to the \texttt{console}
 \item \texttt{History}: all the code that has been run in the \texttt{console}
 \item \texttt{Connections}: connections to databases
 \item \texttt{Files}: the integrated file manager
 \item \texttt{Plots}: display plots
 \item \texttt{Packages}: tools for installing, loading and updating \r \ packages
 \item \texttt{Help}: display help about \r \ functions and packages
 \item \texttt{Viewer}: a html/pdf viewer

\section{\r \ markdown}
\subsection{introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{What is \r \ markdown?}
It is a framework to write reproducible reports, which combines\dots
\begin{itemize}
  \item text
  \item \r \ code
  \item \r\ outputs (e.g. plots, tables)
\end{itemize}
\dots to form a document (e.g. html page, PDF, Microsoft Word, Libre Office, website \dots)
\vfill
Alternative frameworks are available (e.g. these slides are created using a combination of \LaTeX \ and \r, but \r\ markdown remains simple)
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\selectmanualcolour{red!75!black}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Practice}
Render the \r \ markdown file using \texttt{knitr} and observe the outcome
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=0.9\textheight]{../figures/Rmarkdown_knit.png}%
\end{center}
\end{frame}
\selectmanualcolour{blue!75!black}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Why using \r \ markdown?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item clear: text, \r \ code, and output are not dispatched in different files
  \item structured: the document can be divided in sections and the \r \ code into chunks
  \item transparent: all the \r \ code must be in the \r \ markdown file(s)
  \item reproducible: enforce that the \r \ code must run (unlike notebooks and pure \r \ script)
  \item adaptable: you can change one thing and everything else will adjust
  \item dynamic: you can create so-called dynamic html documents (with buttons, menus\dots)
  \item easy to communicate: outputs look quite nice out-of-the-box
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{knitr} is an \r \ package that turns the \r \ code and its outputs into markdown syntax
\item \texttt{pandoc} is an external program that turns markdown documents into many possible outputs
\item the calls to \texttt{knitr} and \texttt{pandox} are orchestrated by the \r \ package \texttt{rmarkdown}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{YAML header}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{The YAML header}
The header sets the configuration for \texttt{pandoc}, so it is used to influence the format and style of the output file

(It is also be used to set some options for \texttt{rmarkdown})
\vfill
\begin{columns}[t]
\column{0.45\linewidth}
A simple YAML header:

output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    theme: journal
    keep_md: yes
---
\end{verbatim}

\vfill
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item indentation matters in YAML!!! (beware while copy \& pasting with RStudio autoindentation)

Check \texttt{Help/Markdown Quick Reference} for (almost) all there is to know!

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height = 4cm]{../figures/Markdown_reference.png}

\vfill

You can directly embed raw \texttt{html} code for more functionalities

For example, this is useful for commenting text that you don't want to appear in the output:

\begin{verbatim}
This text will show in the output <!-- but this one will not -->
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\selectmanualcolour{red!75!black}

Note 1: avoid spaces \& weird characters in object names to avoid troubles (but ``\texttt{\_}'' and ``\texttt{.}'' are OK).

Note 2: names are case sensitive.

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
Usage:
     mean(x, ...)
     ## Default S3 method:
     mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)

Arguments:
       x: An R object.  Currently there are methods for numeric/logical
          vectors and date, date-time and time interval objects, and
          for data frames all of whose columns have a method.  Complex
          vectors are allowed for ‘trim = 0’, only.
    trim: the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be trimmed from
          each end of ‘x’ before the mean is computed.  Values of trim
          outside that range are taken as the nearest endpoint.
   na.rm: a logical value indicating whether ‘NA’ values should be
          stripped before the computation proceeds.

y
y <- 3
y

But not inside functions:
<<>>=
sign(y <- -5) ## dangerous: avoid!
y
sign(x = y <- -5) ## same as above

So better to stick to arrows for creating objects and to equal signs for defining arguments!

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Syntax for functions}
Calling a function without its parentheses reveals its definition:
<<function def>>=
sign

Key facts about packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item a package is just a folder (often compressed) containing \r \ functions, data \& documentation
\item a library is the installed version of the package (also a folder)
\item there are tons of packages out there:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Sexpr{nrow(available.packages(contriburl="http://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib"))} packages are available on \url{cran.r-project.org}
\item $\sim$ 1500 packages aimed at bioinformatics on \url{bioconductor.org}
\item many more on \url{github.com}
\item many more shared between users in other ways

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Installing a package}

Simple situation: the package is available as a binary file prepared for your system on CRAN
<<install package, eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages("dpylr")  ## install dplyr
@

\vfill
\pause
In general, the installation procedure depends on:
\begin{itemize}
\item where the package is being hosted (local, CRAN, bioconductor, GitHub, other)
\item if the package contains sources in another language that have been compiled or not
\end{itemize}

\vfill
\pause
In order to be able to install packages that require compilation (and thus have access to more or newer version of packages), you need to install:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rtools if you use Windows (\url{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/})
\item Xcode if you use macOS (\url{https://developer.apple.com/xcode/})
\item nothing if you use Linux or other Unix-based system
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Installing the package for this course}
The package is not on CRAN as I want to be able to update it instantaneously and have potentially large files.

\vspace{1em}
I host the package here: \url{https://github.com/courtiol/BeginR}
\vfill
You should install it using \texttt{drat} as follows:
<<install BeginR, eval = FALSE>>=
install.packages("drat")    ## install drat from CRAN; only run once per R lifetime
library(drat)               ## load the package drat
addRepo("courtiol")         ## use drat to declare my GitHub account
install.packages("BeginR")  ## install the package
@
\vfill
\pause
Note: every morning of the course you may have to rerun the last 3 lines of code to get the lastest version of this course.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Loading a package}
Loading a package makes new functions and data available to the user:

\vspace{1em}
Example:

<<library BeginR>>=
library(BeginR)
@
\vfill
\pause
You can check the (exported) content of a package:
<<eval = FALSE>>=
library(help = "BeginR")
@
\end{frame}

\section{Housekeeping}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Updating \r \ packages}
Some things to know:
\begin{itemize}
\item \r \ packages evovle quickly
\item young \r \ packages can be very buggy
\item packages are not reviewed\\ (CRAN tests that they can install and that the examples run without generating error or warning messages)
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\pause
Good practice:
\begin{itemize}
\item update your \r \ packages frequently (I do it daily)
\end{itemize}
<<update, eval = FALSE>>=
update.packages(ask = FALSE)  ## or use RStudio menus
@
\begin{itemize}
\item check what is being changed if you heavily rely on a recent package\\ (see file called \texttt{NEWS} easily shown if you use RStudio to update)
\item contact the maintainer when you spot bugs\\ (but write minimal reproductive examples otherwise they will most likely not being able to help you)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Updating \r \ itself}
Some things to know:
\begin{itemize}
\item \r \ has many bugs (like all other software)
\item \r \ bugs are reported, discussed and solved in the open (unlike most other software): \url{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/}
\item each new version of \r \ is more efficient and less buggy
\end{itemize}

\vfill
\pause
What to do?
\begin{itemize}
\item check for \r \ new versions on CRAN
\item check for what has changed if you fancy (\url{http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html})
\item install the new version of \r \ (unless it is not a minor update that you don't need)
\item re-install all your packages
\end{itemize}

\vfill
\pause
Note 1: some packages can help to do this: \verb+InstallR+ on Windows and \verb+UpdateR+ on macOS.\\
\vspace{1em}
Note 2: also update RStudio for full compatibility with \r.
