\description{
This dataset contains a simulated dataset and a simulated pedigree of the
gryphons. The gryphon is a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back
legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and an eagle's talons as its
front feet. This dataset has been released with the publication of a paper
introducing the animal model, a particular LMM used to infer the heritability
of phenotypic traits (see sources). It thus offers the possibility to compare
different packages and software for estimating the heritability.
