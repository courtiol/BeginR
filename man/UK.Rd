\description{
This dataset is a sample of few variables taken from the Ten-Year Follow-up
(1980) of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BSC70).
}
\details{
The BCS70 began in 1970 when data were collected about the 17,198 babies born
in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the week 5-11 April.

At this time, the study was named the British Births Survey (BBS) and it was
sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund, in association with the Royal
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Since 1970, there have been four attempts to gather information from the full
cohort - when they were aged 5, 10, 16 and 26 years. 90% of the 1970 Cohort
were traced and completed one or more survey documents.

In 1975 and 1980, the cohort was augmented by the inclusion of immigrants to
Britain who were born in the target week in 1970. Subjects from Northern
Ireland who had been included in the birth survey, were dropped from the
study in all subsequent sweeps.

The BCS70 Ten-year Follow-up is the second full national follow-up of the
1970 cohort born in Great Britain 5-11 April 1970. The cohort has been
surveyed comprehensively at birth, five, ten, 16 and 26 years, and samples
were seen at 22 months, 42 months, seven and 21 years. The BCS70 Ten-year
Follow-up was originally titled the Child Health and Education Study (CHES),
but in 1991 the whole 1970 Cohort Study was renamed the British Cohort Study
1970 (BCS70) and the ten-year sweep became known as BCS70 Ten-year Follow-up.
