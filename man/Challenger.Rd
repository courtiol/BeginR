\description{
Edited from (Draper, 1993): The motivation for collecting this database was
the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January, 1986. An
investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system.
The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field
joints on one of the two solid booster rockets. Each of these six field
joints includes two O-rings, designated as primary and secondary, which fail
when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur. The night before the
launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety. The discussion
among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that
the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at
launch, which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering
reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that
failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops. One other
variable, the pressure at which safety testing for field join leaks was
performed, was available, but its relevance to the failure process was
unclear.
