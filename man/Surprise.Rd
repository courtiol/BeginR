This dataset is the result of a controlled study in which 852 parents from one
canadian school were divided into six groups of equal size and given gifts of
different types (1 type per group) and of different costs (between ca 15 to 100
dollars). After delivering the gifts to their children the parents reported
the perceived joy of their children on a continuous scale between 0 and 100.
