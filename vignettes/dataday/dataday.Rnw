\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vector}
\begin{center}
A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type
\vfill
\end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Vectors allow the organisation of entities (e.g. numbers, characters. . . ) along one dimension which can be indexed

  <<defining heights, echo = T>>=
height.girls <- c(178, 175, 159, 164, 183, 192)
height.boys <- c(181, 189, 174, 177)
@

  <<printing indexes height, echo = T>>=
height.girls[2]

height.boys[3]

@

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vector}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item They can be combined:

  << combining heights, echo = T>>=
(height <- c(height.boys, height.girls))
@

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Vector continued}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item They can be indexed logically (i.e. indexed by anything leading to a vector of booleans):

  <<filtering heights, echo = T>>=
(height > 168)
@

  <<boolean heights, echo = T>>=
height[height > 168]
height[!(height == min(height))]
height[height != min(height)]

\subsection{Factors}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Factors}
  \begin{itemize}

"boy","boy","boy","boy")

sex

  <<factors sex other options,echo = T>>=
# Or

\subsection{what is a data frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data frames}
\begin{center}
Data frames allow the organisation of entities as a matrix-like structure whose columns have the same length:
\end{center}
\vfill
<<create Data frame>>=

dataframe.ht <- data.frame(Height = height, Sex = sex)
dataframe.ht

@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data frames}
\begin{center}
It is good practice to always check their structure:
\end{center}
<<str data frame, echo = T>>=
str(dataframe.ht)
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data frames}
\begin{center}
You access the columns by means of the extractor  \texttt{\$}
\vspace{1em}
\end{center}
<<access column df>>=
height
rm(list = c("height", "sex")) # removing original vectors
height
dataframe.ht$Height #Or: with(data = dataframe.ht, Height)
@
\vfill
\begin{center}
\textcolor{purple}{$\Rightarrow$ What is the average height?}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Data frames}
Some functions can take a data frame as an input:
\vfill
<<summary df>>=
summary(dataframe.ht)
@
\vfill
Note: this will be the case of a lot of functions performing statistical tests!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\
\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Data frames}
How to compute the average height per sex?
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item simple
<<mean col df>>=
mean(dataframe.ht$Height[dataframe.ht$Sex == "boy"])
@
\item more elegant
<<mean col df2>>=
tapply(X = dataframe.ht$Height, INDEX = dataframe.ht$Sex,
       FUN = mean)
# Or: with(data = dataframe.ht, tapply(X = Height,
#   INDEX = Sex, FUN = mean))
@
\item even more elegant but dangerous
<<mean col df3>>=
library(dplyr)
dataframe.ht %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarize(mean = mean(Height))  ## be aware of the rounding
@

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\
\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Data frames}
They can also be indexed:
\vspace{1em}
<<index df>>=
dataframe.ht[1, ]
dataframe.ht[, 1]  # Or: dataframe.ht[, "Sex"]
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Data frames}
They can be edited:
\vspace{1em}
<<edit df>>=
dataframe.ht[1, 1]
dataframe.ht[1, 1] <- 171.3
dataframe.ht[1, 1]
dataframe.ht$linenumber <- 1:nrow(dataframe.ht)  # add column
ncol(dataframe.ht) # try dim()
dataframe.ht$linenumber <- NULL  # remove column
ncol(dataframe.ht)
@
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data frames}
They can be edited with dpylr way

\vspace{1em}
add column with \texttt{mutate()}
<<edit df dplyr>>=
dataframe.ht <- dataframe.ht %>% mutate(linenumber = 1:nrow(dataframe.ht))
head(dataframe.ht, n= 3)
@
\vspace{1em}

\pause

select columns with \texttt{mutate()}
<<select dplyr>>=
dataframe.ht.sex <- dataframe.ht %>% select(Sex)
head(dataframe.ht.sex, n= 3)
@
\vspace{1em}

\pause

select rows with \texttt{mutate()}
<<filter dplyr>>=
datafrane.ht.female <- dataframe.ht %>% filter(Sex == "girl")
head(datafrane.ht.female, n= 3)
